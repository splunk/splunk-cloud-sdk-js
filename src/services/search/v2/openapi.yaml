          description: |
            Specifies a maximum time interval, in seconds, between identical existing searches. The 'requiredFreshness' parameter is used to determine if an existing search with the same query and the same time boundaries can be reused, instead of running the same search again. Freshness is applied to the 'resolvedEarliest' and 'resolvedLatest' parameters. If an existing search has the same exact criteria as this search and the 'resolvedEarliest' and 'resolvedLatest' values are within the freshness interval, the existing search metadata is returned instead of initiating a new search job. By default, the 'requiredFreshness' parameter is set to 0 which means that the platform does not attempt to use an existing search. The maximum value for the 'requiredFreshness' parameter is 259200 seconds (72 hours).
